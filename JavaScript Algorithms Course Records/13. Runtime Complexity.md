# **Runtime Complexity 04.23**

## **Definition**
Describes the performance of an algorithm

- Goal: to identify the given runtime complexity!

How much more processing power/time is required to run the algorithm if we doulbe the inputs?


### **Exmaples**

1. String Reverse : Each additional character = 1 step through 1 loop <br/>
This would be 'N', or 'linear' runtime. 

2. Print Steps : 2 netsted loops <br/>
This would be N*N = N^2, or quadratic runtime


### **Complexity**

![ComplexityTable](complexity.png)

- O(1) : holy grail 
- O(logN) : search algorithm.. search through sorted data
- O(N) : simple, straightforward iterate through some string, array.. from 0 to to the length
- O(N*longN) : any sorting operation
- N^2 : the handshake problem 
- 2^N : exponential time.. => very big bad deal
